# vite-starter-react-bun

Starter for [vitejs](https://vitejs.dev) with React and:

- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com),
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com),
- hosted fonts,
- eslint,
- typescript,
- [vitest](https://vitest.dev)

This project uses [bun](https://bun.sh) as dependency manager. It means there is no yarn, no npm stuff here.

## Quick start:

```bash
bun install
bun run lint
bun run test # watch mode
bun run test:cov # one shot with coverage
bun run dev # development server
bun run build # production
bun run preview # preview production
```
